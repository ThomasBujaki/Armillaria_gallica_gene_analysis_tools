\begin{itemize}
\item Attempt to find larger indels using a different methodology
\item Take full inventory, via blastn, of all the indels identified and the immediate regions surrounding them 
\item Create a more robust method to search for regions of high read depth
\item Take full inventory of all the sequences at regions of high read depth
\item Look at the sequences which result from comparison of 
\item Search for transposons
\item Complete De novo assemblies and carry out many of these analyses on those
\item Look into the reads which did not align to the reference and attempt to find any variation which may exist between the strains
\end{itemize}
